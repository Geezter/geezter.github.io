            <h2>About</h2>
        <p>SpongeBob SquarePants is an energetic and optimistic yellow sea sponge who lives 
            in a submerged pineapple. SpongeBob has a childlike enthusiasm for life, which 
            carries over to his job as a fry cook at a fast food restaurant called the 
            Krusty Krab. One of his lifeâ€™s greatest goals is to obtain a boat-driving license 
            from Mrs. Puff's Boating School, but he never succeeds. <br> His favorite pastimes 
            include "jellyfishing", which involves catching jellyfish with a net in a manner 
            similar to butterfly catching, and blowing soap bubbles into elaborate shapes.
            He has a pet sea snail with a pink shell and a blue body named Gary, who meows 
            like a cat.</p>
